As noted in the overview, you won't create a new Gradle project from scratch in IntelliJ for this assignment; nor will you create a Git repository from scratch. Instead, you'll be creating a repository from a template, adding your instructor as a collaborator (so that your work can be evaluated), then cloning the repository and opening its contents in IntelliJ. As you do work on the assignment, you'll commit your work to your local repository, and push those commits (at least once, but preferably more than that) back to the remote repository in GitHub.

Please see the instructions in the following pages to create the repository in GitHub and clone it in IntelliJ.
